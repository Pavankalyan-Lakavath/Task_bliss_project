# Task_bliss_project
As a student, we usually log in to many sites, open wikis simultaneously, watch videos
on some other tab and the browser gets filled with all the unnecessary tabs. The project
aims to ease the work of students. Instead of visiting several sites, “TaskBliss” is a
one-stop solution for it. Containing several features and a user-friendly UI. TaskBliss
can bring all the tabs to a single site. From a to-do list to getting youtube videos and
making notes, everything will be saved in one place with a fully flexible authentication
system
